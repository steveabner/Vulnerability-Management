## Introduction

In this project, I established a secure Azure network using an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. A deliberately vulnerable Windows 10 VM was created by installing outdated software and disabling security controls. After installing OpenVAS, I conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans, analyzing the results to highlight their differences. The identified vulnerabilities will be remediated and verified through follow-up scans. Additionally, I compiled a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic remediation scenarios.

---

Next, I will search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED" and proceed to click on it.

![2024-09-27 23_01_31-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda0ff16-af5c-4f87-bbb3-5b70ee1987f7)

---

On the subsequent page, I will ensure that the "basic plan" is selected and choose "Start with a pre-set configuration."

---

To optimize costs, I will select the Dev/Test option and a D-series VM, then click "Continue to create VM."

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ceff843-0676-426c-85b9-795d856fec0a)

---

In the basic tab, I will designate my resource group, assign a name to the virtual machine, set the appropriate region, verify the image, and create a username and password.

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731d9aed-0169-433e-9676-691971dd7952)

---

On the monitoring tab, I will disable boot diagnostics as it is not required. Finally, I will click "Review + Create" and await the completion of the deployment.

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6567a761-4190-4d3a-818d-2dff048ee96d)

---

The OpenVAS VM has been created.

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3590aef5-b239-4fc1-a418-41ce9f1d05d6)

---

To find the IP address of the OpenVAS VM, I will go to "Virtual Machines" in the Azure portal and select it.

![2024-09-28 16_03_08-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b9468c-99e4-4511-929e-8b6ae40ca1f1)

---

On the Virtual Machines page, I will click on the OpenVAS VM I just created.

![2024-09-28 16_03_45-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82980cdf-8c8e-4430-a275-fb6f5c2328cf)

---

On the OpenVAS VM page, I will copy the public IP address, then proceed to the next step and SSH into the OpenVAS VM.

![2024-09-28 16_05_45-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cffba66-a598-4a94-a33c-80fa1cd7e83e)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Initial SSH into OpenVAS to gather the URL, username, and password.</summary>

Now that the OpenVAS VM has been created, I will SSH into it using PowerShell with the credentials established during the VM creation process.

![2024-09-28 00_37_33-labuser@openvas_ ~](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3364f7a-122b-4853-a364-a2eed68f84c2)

---

After logging into the OpenVAS VM, we will wait, as OpenVAS indicates that it may take 15-20 minutes to fully update the CVE database—perfect time to grab a coffee.

After 15-20 minutes have passed, take note of the OpenVAS server URL, username, and password.

![2024-09-28 00_36_26-labuser@openvas_ ~](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9dca21-5680-4e28-9e54-82c7962c4ac5)

---

Next, I will open a browser and access the OpenVAS Dashboard using the URL I retrieved earlier. Following that, I will log in with the provided credentials.

![2024-09-28 22_29_09-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9378191f-af09-432f-b26b-941d851c5222)

---

I now have access to the OpenVAS dashboard. However, my next step is to set up a vulnerable machine, which will be addressed in the next section.

---

In the next section, I will start the unauthenticated scan, see you there.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Performing the Unauthenticated Scan</summary>

Now that I have OpenVAS set up properly, I'll perform the first Unauthenticated scan by navigating to "Scans" and then selecting "Tasks."

![2024-09-29 00_21_58-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73784893-c976-4e2e-be3f-cef2d0274cd0)

---

On the tasks page, we can see the "Scan - Azure Vulnerable VM" task that I created earlier. To the right, I'll click "Start"

![2024-09-30 00_49_48-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192eb9e7-869a-4169-8057-5f7cf012ec3d)

---

Now, I'll just be patient and wait for the scan to complete by periodically checking the status. 

![2024-09-30 00_53_50-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a913df-1597-4e67-9d65-b3d79765b9e7) ![2024-09-30 00_56_03-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea52adcd-c3e1-4538-ad56-fbbdae28a564) ![2024-09-30 00_57_40-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbfc03f-51aa-4e55-87c2-9034e3bbfba5)

---

Now that the scan has been completed, we can see the pie charts, report, and severity. I will click on the report.

![2024-09-30 19_50_33-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/614111d6-ea51-4fe8-af24-65b4370841a5)

---

On the reports page, I’ll click the Results tab to see all the vulnerabilities detected by the scanner, but I’ll ignore them for now since I’ll address them in a later section.


Please note that none of the outdated software I installed on the Virtual Machine is listed here. This is because I didn't perform an authenticated scan. That highlights the difference between authenticated and unauthenticated scans.

![2024-09-30 20_00_40-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad5fbd5-ccd2-4d7a-9f7d-286d443f3538)

---

Now it's time to set up an authenticated scan, see you in the next section.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Setting up VM for an Authenticated Scan</summary>

Now that we’ve completed the unauthenticated scan, it’s time to run an authenticated scan. This will enable the scanner to access the VM and identify more vulnerabilities.

To facilitate authenticated scans I need to remote into the VM to configure some settings. 

---
First I will disable User Account Control. This will allow the scanner to operate without interruptions from prompts, etc.

I'll click Start, search for User Account Control, and select it. Then I'll adjust the slider to "Never Notify."

![2024-09-30 20_23_32-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7694e85-6ab1-4632-afb4-e11d63295e63)

---

Next, I will enable Remote Registry.

I will click on Start, search for services.msc, and select it.

![2024-09-30 20_28_27-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f52acb-4816-4200-a627-e18d399a6aa3)

---

In the Services window, I will scroll down, locate Remote Registry, and set the startup type to Automatic, Then click start

![2024-09-30 20_42_23-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/794c48f3-0a2e-48a8-a285-12cce620958e)

<!-- in Azure and collected log data from various sources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel utilizes this workspace to create attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents. I recorded security metrics in the unsecured environment for 24 hours, implemented security controls to enhance the environment, measured metrics for another 24 hours, and then presented the results below. The metrics include:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet)

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls
![Honeynet After Hardening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ff760f-7f42-42a7-b18b-55ab8a3b03f7)


The mini honeynet architecture in Azure comprises the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (1 Windows, 1 Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed and exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls fully open, and all other resources were accessible through public endpoints, with no use of Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, the Network Security Groups were tightened by blocking all traffic except from my admin workstation, and all other resources were secured with their built-in firewalls and Private Endpoints.

- Start Time 9/25/2024, 9:57AM
- Stop Time 9/26/2024, 9:57AM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 2798
| Syslog                   | 0
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was set up in Microsoft Azure, with log sources integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Metrics were recorded in the insecure environment before applying security controls and then again after implementing them. The significant reduction in security events and incidents after applying the security controls highlighted their effectiveness.

It is important to mention that if the resources within the network had been heavily utilized by regular users, more security events and alerts might have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls. -->
