## Introduction

In this project, I established a secure Azure network using an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. A deliberately vulnerable Windows 10 VM was created by installing outdated software and disabling security controls. After installing OpenVAS, I conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans, analyzing the results to highlight their differences. The identified vulnerabilities will be remediated and verified through follow-up scans. Additionally, I compiled a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic remediation scenarios.


## Create and setup the OpenVAS VM

To begin, I will access the Azure portal to configure a new virtual machine for the OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner.

Within the Azure portal, I will navigate to the "Marketplace" and select it.

---

Next, I will search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED" and proceed to click on it.

![2024-09-27 23_01_31-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda0ff16-af5c-4f87-bbb3-5b70ee1987f7)

---

On the subsequent page, I will ensure that the "basic plan" is selected and choose "Start with a pre-set configuration."

---

To optimize costs, I will select the Dev/Test option and a D-series VM, then click "Continue to create VM."

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ceff843-0676-426c-85b9-795d856fec0a)

---

In the basic tab, I will designate my resource group, assign a name to the virtual machine, set the appropriate region, verify the image, and create a username and password.

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731d9aed-0169-433e-9676-691971dd7952)

---

On the monitoring tab, I will disable boot diagnostics as it is not required. Finally, I will click "Review + Create" and await the completion of the deployment.

The OpenVAS VM has been created.

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3590aef5-b239-4fc1-a418-41ce9f1d05d6)

---

To find the IP address of the OpenVAS VM, I will go to "Virtual Machines" in the Azure portal and select it.

![2024-09-28 16_03_08-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b9468c-99e4-4511-929e-8b6ae40ca1f1)

---

On the Virtual Machines page, I will click on the OpenVAS VM I just created.

![2024-09-28 16_03_45-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82980cdf-8c8e-4430-a275-fb6f5c2328cf)

---

On the OpenVAS VM page, I will copy the public IP address, then proceed to the next step and SSH into the OpenVAS VM.

![2024-09-28 16_05_45-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cffba66-a598-4a94-a33c-80fa1cd7e83e)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Initial SSH into OpenVAS to gather the URL, username, and password.</summary>

Now that the OpenVAS VM has been created, I will SSH into it using PowerShell with the credentials established during the VM creation process.

![2024-09-28 00_37_33-labuser@openvas_ ~](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3364f7a-122b-4853-a364-a2eed68f84c2)

After logging into the OpenVAS VM, we will wait, as OpenVAS indicates that it may take 15-20 minutes to fully update the CVE databaseâ€”perfect time to grab a coffee.

After 15-20 minutes have passed, take note of the OpenVAS server URL, username, and password.

![2024-09-28 00_36_26-labuser@openvas_ ~](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9dca21-5680-4e28-9e54-82c7962c4ac5)

Next, I will open a browser and access the OpenVAS Dashboard using the URL I retrieved earlier. Following that, I will log in with the provided credentials.

![2024-09-28 22_29_09-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9378191f-af09-432f-b26b-941d851c5222)

I now have access to the OpenVAS dashboard. However, my next step is to set up a vulnerable machine, which will be addressed in the next section.

<!-- in Azure and collected log data from various sources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel utilizes this workspace to create attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents. I recorded security metrics in the unsecured environment for 24 hours, implemented security controls to enhance the environment, measured metrics for another 24 hours, and then presented the results below. The metrics include:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet)

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls
![Honeynet After Hardening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ff760f-7f42-42a7-b18b-55ab8a3b03f7)


The mini honeynet architecture in Azure comprises the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (1 Windows, 1 Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed and exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls fully open, and all other resources were accessible through public endpoints, with no use of Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, the Network Security Groups were tightened by blocking all traffic except from my admin workstation, and all other resources were secured with their built-in firewalls and Private Endpoints.

<!-- ## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The table below presents the metrics measured in my insecure environment over a 24-hour period:

- Start Time 9/23/2024, 1:35PM
- Stop Time 9/24/2024, 1:35PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 82091
| Syslog                   | 22019
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 282
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 3553

## Attack Maps After Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The table below displays the metrics measured in my environment over a 24-hour period following the implementation of security controls:

- Start Time 9/25/2024, 9:57AM
- Stop Time 9/26/2024, 9:57AM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 2798
| Syslog                   | 0
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was set up in Microsoft Azure, with log sources integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Metrics were recorded in the insecure environment before applying security controls and then again after implementing them. The significant reduction in security events and incidents after applying the security controls highlighted their effectiveness.

It is important to mention that if the resources within the network had been heavily utilized by regular users, more security events and alerts might have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls. -->
