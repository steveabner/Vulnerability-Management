# Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Project


## Introduction

In this project, I established a secure Azure network using an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. A deliberately vulnerable Windows 10 VM was created by installing outdated software and disabling security controls. After installing OpenVAS, I conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans, analyzing the results to highlight their differences. The identified vulnerabilities will be remediated and verified through follow-up scans. Additionally, I compiled a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic remediation scenarios.

<!-- in Azure and collected log data from various sources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel utilizes this workspace to create attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents. I recorded security metrics in the unsecured environment for 24 hours, implemented security controls to enhance the environment, measured metrics for another 24 hours, and then presented the results below. The metrics include:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet)

The mini honeynet architecture in Azure comprises the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (1 Windows, 1 Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed and exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls fully open, and all other resources were accessible through public endpoints, with no use of Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, the Network Security Groups were tightened by blocking all traffic except from my admin workstation, and all other resources were secured with their built-in firewalls and Private Endpoints.

<!-- ## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The table below presents the metrics measured in my insecure environment over a 24-hour period:

- Start Time 9/23/2024, 1:35PM
- Stop Time 9/24/2024, 1:35PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 82091
| Syslog                   | 22019
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 282
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 3553

## Attack Maps After Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The table below displays the metrics measured in my environment over a 24-hour period following the implementation of security controls:

- Start Time 9/25/2024, 9:57AM
- Stop Time 9/26/2024, 9:57AM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 2798
| Syslog                   | 0
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was set up in Microsoft Azure, with log sources integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Metrics were recorded in the insecure environment before applying security controls and then again after implementing them. The significant reduction in security events and incidents after applying the security controls highlighted their effectiveness.

It is important to mention that if the resources within the network had been heavily utilized by regular users, more security events and alerts might have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls. -->
